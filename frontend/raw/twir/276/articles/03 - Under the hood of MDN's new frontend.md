# Item 3: Under the hood of MDN's new frontend

Source: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/mdn-front-end-deep-dive/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/mdn-front-end-deep-dive/)

Summary:
MDN describes the motivations and process behind rebuilding its frontend, moving away from a heavily customized, technical debt-laden React app. The new approach leverages static content generation and introduces web components (using Lit) for interactive elements within mostly static documentation. The article details architectural changes, challenges with the previous React setup, and how web components improved maintainability and interactivity without overcomplicating the React boundary.

Key takeaways:
- MDN's previous React frontend suffered from technical debt, complex build tooling, and CSS issues.
- Static content and interactivity needs led to a hybrid approach: static HTML with web components for dynamic features.
- Web components (via Lit) enable encapsulated, reusable interactivity (e.g., Scrimba embeds) within static content.
- The new architecture improves maintainability and developer experience while reducing client-side complexity.

# Under the hood of MDN's new frontend

Last year, we [launched a new frontend for MDN](/en-US/blog/launching-new-front-end/).
The most noticeable changes were adjustments to our styles; we simplified and unified the MDN design across all of our pages.
In truth, the biggest changes were not reader-visible, but rather in the overhauled code that powers our frontend.
This post describes what we've done, the technologies we chose, and why we did it at all.

To fully understand the changes we made to MDN's frontend, I should provide some context on how MDN content is assembled into the website you all know and love.
MDN's architecture is probably worthy of its own blog post, but to simplify for the sake of this post, pages are published to the site via these major steps:

1. The documentation is written and maintained in Markdown, across a couple of git repositories, by our fantastic team of technical writers, partners, and invited experts, alongside our enormous community of contributors and translators.
2. A build tool ingests these Markdown files, converts them into HTML, and saves them as a set of JSON files with supplemental metadata about each page.
3. Our frontend traverses these JSON files and compiles fully-featured pages, complete with browser compatibility tables, l10n support, navigation menus, and so on - in a step we name (or perhaps misname) [server-side rendering](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSR) (SSR).
4. At this point, the resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are uploaded to cloud buckets and delivered to our readers globally.

A build tool converting Markdown to HTML and JSON metadata; 3. Frontend SSR compiling JSON into full pages with compat tables, l10n, navigation, Web Components, and Server Components; 4. Cloud delivery of HTML, CSS, and JS via CDN to readers globally.](/en-US/blog/mdn-front-end-deep-dive/architecture.svg)

Rebuilding our frontend had been a long time coming because of how tricky it was to work on MDN's UI.
Our previous frontend (called **yari**) was a React app that, unfortunately, had accumulated quite a lot of technical debt.
Maintenance wasn't exactly impossible, but was certainly painful to undertake.
Whenever we fixed issues or added new site functionality, we inevitably ended up piling on more technical debt.
But how did we get there?

The React app had started life as a "Create React App", but a number of the built-in defaults didn't work for us.
Of course, this led to a series of workarounds, and we eventually had to ["eject" the configuration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject). We ended up with an extremely complicated Webpack config as well as some very hacky build scripts.

On the CSS side as well, things were starting to get out of control.
We used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) extensively, then added modern CSS features like CSS variables, which meant we had a bizarre mix of both idioms spread across our files.

The CSS was also incredibly entangled, with poor or nonexistent scoping.
When we made a change in one UI component, we'd frequently spot unintended changes in others.
These issues, and a lack of build tools to split up the CSS, meant we had to ship a large render-blocking CSS blob to our users, complete with styles for components they might never load.

But by far, the biggest issue was that our React app was merely a wrapper around our static content.
To make the React app aware of the HTML content that our build tool generated would have required expensive reparsing of the HTML and an extraordinary amount of logic which we'd have to ship to users in our client-side JavaScript.
We didn't want to do this, so the React app boundary essentially ended where our documentation began â we used React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to insert the content.

Our content is *mostly* static (prose and code examples), but there were a number of places within this static content where we needed to add interactivity (think things like the "Copy" button on code blocks).
For these interactive parts, we ended up using regular DOM APIs, which wasn't very elegant, particularly when the rest of the site was written in React.
We couldn't use [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) (React's HTML-like syntax), which limited the maintainability of more complex pieces of interactivity, and we occasionally faced the worst-case scenario of maintaining duplicate implementations - one using React and another using DOM APIs.

As a possible solution to this problem, in 2024, we started experimenting with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and [web components](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) to see whether they could improve the developer experience when working on this kind of interactivity within content.
Our first proper prototype, and eventual production implementation, came out of our work on the [MDN Curriculum](/en-US/curriculum/) when we partnered with [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

Scrimba has a feature called "Scrims" - an interactive learning environment we embed on MDN via an `<iframe>`. Scrims let learners watch a short coding tutorial and then edit the code themselves, all within the same view â think of them as interactive screencasts.

On our pages, we didn't want to send any user data to Scrimba until a user chose to interact with their content; so we didn't load the `<iframe>` until after a user clicks to open it.
We also wanted to be able to expand the Scrim to fullscreen, without a user leaving MDN, so we used the [`<dialog>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog) element.

We figured that building a web component would allow us to use a custom element to insert these Scrims directly into our content, thereby skipping a number of rendering steps and avoiding the tricky-to-maintain DOM API implementation.

Our component starts life by extending `LitElement`:

```
export class MDNScrimInline extends LitElement {}
```

Within that, we need to define some state.
In Lit, we can do this through a static properties attribute:

```
static properties = {
  // the url to the scrim, set as an attribute on our custom element
  url: { type: String },
  // internal state tracking if the element is fullscreen
  _fullscreen: { state: true },
  // internal state tracking if weâve rendered the <iframe> yet
  _scrimLoaded: { state: true },
};
```

And we set defaults in our class constructor:

```
constructor() {
  super();
  this.url = undefined;
  this._fullscreen = false;
  this._scrimLoaded = false;
}
```

We want to manipulate the URL which has been provided as an attribute to our custom element.
Lit provides us with [lifecycle methods](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/) to do this. We want to compute a value once we know an update to the component will be rendered:

```
willUpdate(changedProperties) {
  if (changedProperties.has("url")) {
    if (this.url) {
      const url = new URL(this.url);
      url.searchParams.set("via", "mdn");
      url.searchParams.set("embed", "");
      this._fullUrl = url.toString();
    } else {
      this._fullUrl = undefined;
    }
  }
}
```

We can then use this state to render our component:

```
return html`
  <dialog @close=${this.#dialogClosed}>
    <div class="inner">
      <div class="header">
        <span>Clicking will load content from scrimba.com</span>
        <button tabindex="0" @click=${this.#toggle} class="toggle">
          Toggle fullscreen
        </button>
        <a href=${this._fullUrl}> Open on Scrimba </a>
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        ${this._scrimLoaded
          ? html`
              <iframe
                src=${this._fullUrl}
                title=${ifDefined(this.scrimTitle)}></iframe>
            `
          : html`
              <button @click=${this.#open}>Load scrim and open dialog.</button>
            `}
      </div>
    </div>
  </dialog>
`;
```

Lit's `html` template literal is just as convenient as JSX in allowing us to write HTML-ish syntax in JavaScript.
The huge advantage over JSX is it doesn't require any compilation to use: it's native JavaScript.

I say "HTML-ish" because you'll notice a few annotations before certain attributes in the template above, namely `@close` and `@click`.
This is Lit syntax that allows us to bind event listeners to these elements: the close event on the `<dialog>` and click events on a couple of buttons.
We define these in the class too:

```
#toggle(e) {
  if (this._fullscreen) {
    this.#close();
  } else {
    this.#open();
  }
}

#open() {
  const dialog = this.renderRoot.querySelector("dialog");
  if (dialog) {
    dialog.showModal();
    this._scrimLoaded = true;
    this._fullscreen = true;
  }
}

#close() {
  const dialog = this.renderRoot.querySelector("dialog");
  dialog?.close();
}

#dialogClosed() {
  this._fullscreen = false;
}
```

When a user clicks to open the Scrim, the `#open` method fires, which updates the values of `_scrimLoaded` and `_fullscreen`.
Lit notices the changes to these properties, because we'd defined them in `static properties`, and automatically re-renders the component, loading the `<iframe>` and the Scrim inside.

I've simplified the component a little for brevity, you can see the [`MDNScrimInline` source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/fred/blob/main/components/scrim-inline/element.js).
There's a number of additions in there like telemetry, and a dynamically-rendered thumbnail (it was fewer bytes and a simpler implementation than pre-rendering a bunch of images).
As you can imagine, this was very straightforward to develop, thanks to the convenience functions we get with Lit; this would've been a massive headache to implement directly with traditional DOM APIs.

In many ways, I found that the implementation in Lit was simpler than in React: you may notice the state we're dealing with isn't particularly complex, and doesn't require a complex component architecture to reflect it.
But more importantly, it gives us that custom element we can insert into our curriculum content wherever we need to add a Scrim:

```
<scrim-inline
  url="https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~0lr"
  scrimtitle="The Request-Response Cycle"></scrim-inline>
```

The Scrimba implementation was a good introduction for the team to writing a small component, but what about something more complex?
Interactive examples are the components that appear under "Try it" sections at the top of many CSS, JavaScript, and HTML pages.

Improving the infrastructure for these had been on the engineering team backlog for a while; they were difficult for our technical writers and community to maintain and author.
The existing implementation was split across four git repositories, and authoring or debugging an example could require synchronizing changes across them all.
Worse still, examples had to be written in isolation from the content they'd be included in, so it wasn't possible to show a live preview containing both changes to an example and the content of the MDN page it would be included on.

This complexity came about for good reasons: these interactive examples were too complex to easily engineer and maintain with DOM APIs directly.
Instead, we had a separate build system and examples repository which rendered these examples into separate HTML pages which we could load in an `<iframe>` directly.

We wanted to simplify this architecture, to make writing interactive examples easier for our authors, so again: we reached for Lit to build a web component we could include directly in our content.
This was a much more technically-complex implementation than Scrims.
Firstly, we needed a number of templates for the different ways interactive examples are displayed:

1. A code editor and console for JavaScript examples, with [the addition of tabs for WASM](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Memory/load) examples.
2. A tabbed code editor with rendered output for HTML examples (usually [tabs for HTML and CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p#try_it)).
3. A table of code editors that can be selected with rendered output for CSS examples (see the [CSS `background-clip` property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/background-clip#try_it), for example).

Secondly, we needed a way to render the examples, and the edits users made to them.
We had already written that logic to create our interactive [Playground](/en-US/blog/introducing-the-mdn-playground/), but it was in React: so we needed to port that too.

So we set about doing all that.
What made things a lot simpler was that [Lit's React integration](https://lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/) allowed us to render these web components in our existing React app.
So we could port the elements of the Playground we needed piece-by-piece to web components, without having to port the entire thing all at once, and without having to maintain dual implementations.

At a high level, we split our single entangled Playground React component into a series of custom elements:

- `<play-editor>`: A [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)-powered editor.
- `<play-console>`: An element to format and render console messages.
- `<play-runner>`: An element responsible for rendering the current state of each editor.
- `<play-controller>`: An element responsible for passing events and state between each of the above elements.

This made the logic in the Playground simpler and decoupled, which allowed us to reuse these elements in the `<interactive-example>` element we created.
This included logic to search the page for `<code>` elements the interactive example component should ingest, sending their contents to a `<play-controller>`, and working out which of the above templates it needed to render: using some combination of the `<play-*>` elements to do this.

This meant that authors could now add a macro to content - which renders our `<interactive-example>` custom element behind the scenes - followed by the code blocks the example should use:

```
{{InteractiveExample("CSS Demo: background-repeat")}}

```css interactive-example-choice
background-repeat: space;
```

```css interactive-example-choice
background-repeat: repeat;
```

<!-- etc. -->

```html interactive-example
<section id="default-example">
  <div id="example-element"></div>
</section>
```

```css interactive-example
#example-element {
  background-color: #cccccc;
}
```
```

You can see the full source for this example on the [CSS background-repeat page GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/616b1da6696a833451891ad8c767ff15474b08f7/files/en-us/web/css/background-repeat/index.md?plain=1#L11-L50).
We're not quite sure where we stand on putting custom elements directly in our non-curriculum Markdown content, which could make our architecture even simpler; that's a discussion for another day.

So this is all well and good, web components seem pretty cool and solve some of our problems around adding interactivity within our static content. But wasn't this blog post supposed to be about how we rewrote our entire frontend stack: what happened to that? To answer that, let's get into another problem we had with our old frontend:

I've mentioned our problem with our React app being a "wrapper" and not being able to interact with our content.
The fundamental problem is that (at least classically) React apps are Single Page Applications (SPAs), which you figure out how to render on the server, then attempt to figure out how to avoid shipping an absolutely enormous JavaScript bundle to your users.

That last part is necessary. That's because everything you render in an SPA, even if it could be rendered statically on a server or in a compilation step, has to be shipped in your client-side JavaScript bundle and re-rendered in the client â just to verify nothing has changed.
The React documentation itself summarises it better than I could:

> This pattern means users need to download and parse an additional 75K (gzipped) of libraries, and wait for a second request to fetch the data after the page loads, just to render static content that will not change for the lifetime of the page.   
> [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) on react.dev

That's a quote from the documentation for React Server Components (RSC): so the project recognizes that this is a problem, and is working hard on solving it.
Unfortunately, using RSC effectively requires using a framework that we aren't already using.
Migrating to that would require rewriting a lot of the frontend anyway.

So since a large rewrite was required to address this fundamental issue, we could also re-evaluate what kind of a site MDN is, and how complex it needed to be.
Really, MDN isn't a particularly complex site, at least from a "things that require interactivity" standpoint.
The vast majority of content on an MDN documentation page is HTML and CSS: we don't need a complex app powering the majority of the site.
We essentially have islands of interactivity, which could easily all be implemented as web components.

And if we're implementing all our functionality in isolated web components, it doesn't really matter how they're assembled: we just need to template HTML together, and that can happen multiple times, in multiple places in our overall build system.
There's no higher-level "app" that needs to understand the state of the entire page, so there never could be a "wrapper" problem â our markdown to HTML build tool is just as first class a citizen as whatever templating we need to do in our frontend.

This approach solved all three problems at once: there's no SPA shipping redundant JavaScript to re-render static content, there's no "wrapper" that can't reach into our documentation HTML, and each piece of interactivity is a self-contained web component that only loads when it's needed. What remained was deciding how to do the static templating that assembles everything else.

We considered using a dedicated templating language, such as EJS, to do templating in our frontend, but realized there's a lot of benefits to a component-based architecture.
While doing static HTML templating on the server avoids shipping logic to users in a client-side JavaScript bundle, this HTML still requires styling.
And as you may recall, the CSS in our old frontend was a mess, and we wanted to avoid shipping unnecessary CSS if it wasn't necessary to render the current page.

We first built our own concept of Server Components, using Lit's HTML template literal, which we were already comfortable with.
Here's an example of our top navigation bar component:

```
export class Navigation extends ServerComponent {
  render(context) {
    return html`
      <nav class="navigation" data-open="false">
        <div class="navigation__logo">${Logo.render(context)}</div>
        <button
          class="navigation__button"
          type="button"
          aria-expanded="false"
          aria-controls="navigation__popup"
          aria-label="Toggle navigation"></button>
        <div class="navigation__popup" id="navigation__popup">
          <div class="navigation__menu">${Menu.render(context)}</div>
          <div class="navigation__search" data-view="desktop">
            <mdn-search-button></mdn-search-button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
      <mdn-search-modal id="search"></mdn-search-modal>
    `;
  }
}
```

You'll see the logic is handled in a `render` method, much like it would be in a Lit component.
We don't need any lifecycle methods because this only ever runs once.
This component can render other server components like `Logo` and `Menu`, as well as web components like `<mdn-search-button>` and `<mdn-search-modal>`.

We render this to HTML in NodeJS, using a convenient function Lit provides.
This also renders these Lit web components to [Declarative Shadow DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) so, in compatible browsers, the Shadow DOM and CSS of our custom elements is rendered before the JavaScript gets loaded.

As I mentioned before, one big problem with an SPA-approach to building websites is everything necessary to render the page needs to be included in the client-side JavaScript bundle.
Another similar problem is that it's very easy, and therefore very common, to ship a whole load of code *not* necessary for rendering the current page, and only necessary for rendering other pages, in one huge client-side bundle.
We fell into this trap with our old frontend, both with our JavaScript and our CSS.

Over time we did partition off certain routes into separate chunks, but this was only possible with our JavaScript. Our CSS was too entangled to do this, and our build tool wasn't configured to do it either.

And, it was only possible to do this *per route*, not for components within the same page. If there was a chance a certain route might load a component, it needed to be included in the bundle if it was to be server-side rendered, even if it wasn't, and that JavaScript was never executed client side.

We wanted to avoid all this in our new frontend: only loading the most minimal CSS and JavaScript bundles required to render the page, and making it interactive; and I wanted to achieve this on an architectural level, so it was nearly impossible to not do. We achieved this in a few ways, but the key to unlocking them all was a flat name-based component structure.

Every component lives in a flat hierarchy under the `./components/` directory, with the following file names reserved for certain pieces of the component:

```
components/example-component
âââ element.css
âââ element.js
âââ global.css
âââ server.css
âââ server.js
```

- `element.js` - A web component, exporting a `MDNExampleComponent` class and defining a `<mdn-example-component>` element.
- `server.js` - A server component, extending `ServerComponent` from [`components/server/index.js`](https://github.com/mdn/fred/blob/main/components/server/index.js).
- `server.css` - CSS for a server component that will be automatically loaded for this component from the server.
- `global.css` - CSS for the component that gets loaded everywhere all the time.

We enforce parts of this via linting, and some of this by throwing errors if you don't adhere to the naming requirements.

Because we know where each web component lives based on name, we can do some clever things.
When our page loads, we run logic like this client-side:

```
for (const element of document.querySelectorAll("*")) {
  const tag = element.tagName.toLowerCase();
  if (tag.startsWith("mdn-")) {
    const component = tag.replace("mdn-", "");
    import(`../components/${component}/element.js`);
  }
}
```

This results in lazy-loading every custom element present in the DOM at load time, entirely async and in parallel.
The advantages here are numerous:

- Engineers don't have to remember to import web components in server components; they can use them as if they are normal HTML elements.
- We can add custom elements to our content markdown (either directly or through a macro), without having to wire up an export elsewhere.
- We only ever load the JavaScript for each web component if it's present on the page, automatically.
  It's not necessary for engineers to think about whether their new component increases the bundle size - if it's not present on the page the user is viewing, that code won't end up being loaded by the users' browser.
- Changes to one component should only have minimal impact on the rest of the bundle: a bugfix in one component will require that component's JavaScript to be reloaded, but other components should be cached by the browser and will become interactive almost immediately, as they load in parallel asynchronously.

We also automatically load every web component in our SSR bundle, where Lit renders them into a Declarative Shadow DOM (unless the component opts out because it doesn't make sense to render them on the server).
This helps ensure we don't have layout shifts when the JavaScript loads.
The result is that the slight delay to interactivity when we load its JavaScript after initial render is imperceptible because the component is already on the page, just not interactive yet.

At least, not entirely interactive: this architecture is flexible enough for us to be very clever with certain components.
One of these is `<mdn-dropdown>`.

This is a component which, as the name might suggest, implements a dropdown.
The render method is rather simple:

```
render() {
  return html`
    <slot name="button" @click=${this._toggleDropDown}></slot>
    <slot name="dropdown" ?hidden=${!this.open && this.loaded}></slot>
  `;
}
```

We render two slots, which can be used like so:

```
<mdn-dropdown>
  <button slot="button">Click me</button>
  <div slot="dropdown">Hello world!</div>
</mdn-dropdown>
```

Since we use slots here, `<mdn-dropdown>`'s shadow DOM is almost irrelevant, and any children of it can be styled entirely as normal: the element only adds interactivity.
It *does* have some styles attached, but those aren't for styling: they're for interactivity too.
See, we also have a lifecycle method:

```
firstUpdated() {
  this.loaded = true;
}
```

And define our loaded property like so:

```
static properties = {
  loaded: { type: Boolean, reflect: true },
};
```

If you trace the logic through, you'll see that the dropdown slot isn't hidden by default, and therefore, is visible when we render to DSD on the server.
And once the component is `loaded=true`, we reflect that attribute into the DOM, so it appears like:

```
<mdn-dropdown loaded=""></mdn-dropdown>
```

The reason we want this is because we also attach the following CSS to the element:

```
:host(:not([loaded], :focus-within)) {
  slot[name="dropdown"] {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

The logic here is a little hard to parse - and I say that as the person who wrote it - but it effectively translates to:

- If JavaScript for the `mdn-dropdown` has loaded, do no styling.
- If the JavaScript for the `mdn-dropdown` hasn't loaded, then:
  - If the focus is outside the element, hide the dropdown slot.
  - If the focus is within the element, show the dropdown slot.
    And what does this mean? Well, we have a CSS native dropdown as soon as the page is rendered, which progressively enhances to a JavaScript dropdown, once that code has loaded; other engineers need not know any of this is going on, just that the dropdown component works.

This is hugely important in our top navigation menu, where most of our links are behind dropdowns: those are completely usable as soon as they're rendered to the page.
In other components, such as in our theme switcher, while choosing between themes isn't possible until its JavaScript loads, the dropdown being interactive already gives us a few seconds longer load time for that JavaScript before the user clicks on anything requiring it.

#### What if we don't have DSD

Now, Declarative Shadow DOM isn't widely available yet, so we have to ensure things also work on slightly older browsers.
This is where the `global.css` file comes in: any CSS written in one of these is included on all pages, all the time.

This is obviously necessary for setting things like global CSS variables, global reset styles, and the like.
But for components, when DSD isn't available, before its JavaScript has loaded, they'll appear to the browser as an empty inline element with no styling attached.
This isn't always optimal, and can cause layout shifts when the JavaScript gets loaded, so we set global styles for certain elements, for example, for our button component:

```
mdn-button {
  display: inline-flex;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

This is just enough to ensure buttons don't shift the layout before being loaded.
There's a small optimisation to be had by only loading this style when an `mdn-button` is present on the page, rather than on every page: but it's so minimal it's probably not worth the added complexity.
It's also important for our aforementioned dropdown component: we still want this to be interactive if DSD hasn't loaded, so we include a similar style in a `global.css` file.

For server components, the considerations are a little different. The JavaScript *itself* doesn't need to be lazy loaded or cut down, since it's only being used to SSR our HTML. But what does require careful loading is the CSS used in each server component. We only want to load this if the component gets rendered to the page. But how do we know this?

Our server components extend our `ServerComponent` class, so we place some tracking logic in its static render method, which runs before and after instantiating each server component:

```
export class ServerComponent {
  static render(...args) {
    const { componentsUsed } = asyncLocalStorage.getStore();
    const componentUsedBefore = componentsUsed.has(this.name);
    componentsUsed.add(this.name);
    const renderResult = new this().render(...args);
    if ((!renderResult || renderResult === nothing) && !componentUsedBefore) {
      componentsUsed.delete(this.name);
      return nothing;
    }
    return renderResult;
  }
}
```

This gives us a `Set`, `componentsUsed`, which only contains the components that rendered anything. We then use this in our `OuterLayout` component:

const { componentsUsed, compilationStats } = asyncLocalStorage.getStore();
