# Item 13: Frontend Memory Leaks: A 500-Repository Static Analysis

Source: [https://stackinsight.dev/blog/memory-leak-empirical-study/](https://stackinsight.dev/blog/memory-leak-empirical-study/)

Summary:
This empirical study analyzes 500 public frontend repositories for memory leaks, focusing on missing cleanup in React, Vue, and Angular apps. It finds that 86% of repos have at least one missing-cleanup pattern, with React’s useEffect lacking a cleanup return being a top offender. The study details how such leaks occur, their impact (about 8 KB retained per navigation cycle), and provides actionable advice for engineering leads to audit and fix common patterns.

Key takeaways:
- Memory leaks from missing cleanup in useEffect, subscriptions, and event listeners are widespread in frontend codebases.
- Even with garbage collection, retained references prevent memory from being reclaimed, leading to gradual heap growth.
- Simple audits and fixes (adding cleanup returns) can prevent significant memory bloat in production.

# Frontend Memory Leaks: A 500-Repository Static Analysis and Five-Scenario Benchmark Study

---

You know the moment. You’re clicking through your SPA — navigating pages, filling out forms, switching tabs. Everything feels snappy. Then twenty minutes in, the UI starts stuttering. Scroll events lag. Animations drop frames. You open the Memory tab in DevTools and watch a heap line climb steadily — 200 MB, 300 MB, 400 MB — with no sign of leveling off.

I wanted to know how common this really is — and what it actually costs. So I built AST-based detectors for React, Vue, and Angular, pointed them at 500 public repositories, then wrote controlled benchmarks that simulate what happens when cleanup is missing. One hundred mount/unmount cycles, fifty independent repeats, forced garbage collection before every measurement.

The short version: **86% of repos have at least one missing-cleanup pattern.** The scan found **55,864 potential leak instances** across 714,217 files. And every benchmark scenario showed the same result — roughly **8 KB of retained heap growth per cycle** when cleanup is missing, versus near-zero growth when it’s handled properly.

Here’s the full data and analysis.

## What “memory leak” actually means in a garbage-collected runtime

Before the numbers, one misconception needs clearing up.

*“JavaScript has garbage collection, so memory leaks can’t really happen.”*

This is wrong, and understanding why matters for everything that follows.

V8’s garbage collector reclaims objects that are **unreachable** — no live reference chain connects them to a GC root. The GC has no concept of developer intent. It only knows what’s *reachable*.

Here’s what happens when a React component adds an event listener without cleanup:

```
useEffect(() => {
  const handler = () => { /* uses component state */ };
  window.addEventListener('resize', handler);
  // No cleanup return — handler stays registered forever
}, []);
```

When the component unmounts, React throws away its fiber. But `window` is a GC root, and its event listener list still holds a reference to `handler`. That closure captured the component’s state. The reference chain is:

```
window → event listener list → handler closure → component state → data
```

Every object in that chain is *reachable*. The GC will never collect them. **This is not a GC failure — it’s an application-level bug.** The developer created a reference chain they didn’t intend to preserve.

The same mechanism applies to every framework:

- **React**: `useEffect` without cleanup → listener/timer/subscription stays alive
- **Vue**: `onMounted` without `onUnmounted` → timer holds component data; `watch()` without stop handle → watcher registry holds callback

> **Vue 3 automatic cleanup clarification:** Starting with Vue 3.0 (September 2020), watchers created synchronously inside a component’s `setup()` function or `<script setup>` are automatically disposed when the component unmounts. This means `watch()` and `watchEffect()` calls in standard component code don’t require manual cleanup in most cases. However, memory leaks still occur when watchers are created in **async callbacks**, **standalone functions outside component scope**, or when using **manual timers/listeners** that Vue’s reactivity system doesn’t track. The benchmark scenarios (SC2, SC4) focus on these edge cases and demonstrate that when automatic cleanup doesn’t apply, the leak rate is identical across frameworks (~8 KB/cycle).

This distinction is why our benchmarks force GC before every snapshot. We measure what’s **retained** — what GC *cannot* collect — not what’s merely *pending* collection.

## Part 1: How common are missing-cleanup patterns in the wild?

### How the scan works

I built three AST-based detectors (adapted from [Code Evolution Lab](https://codeevolutionlab.com)), one per framework. Each parses JavaScript and TypeScript source files with Babel and walks the syntax tree, matching setup calls that create resources against corresponding cleanup calls in the same scope.

| Framework | Patterns Detected |
| --- | --- |
| **Vue** | `onMounted` without `onUnmounted` cleanup, `watch`/`watchEffect` without stop handle, manual `addEventListener` in setup without removal, event bus `.on()` without `.off()` |

Cross-framework: `IntersectionObserver`/`MutationObserver`/`ResizeObserver` without `.disconnect()`, `requestAnimationFrame` without `cancelAnimationFrame`.

#### Repository selection methodology

The 500 repositories were selected through a targeted sampling strategy focused on production-quality code:

**Selection criteria:**

1. **Lifecycle intensity** — Apps with frequent mount/unmount cycles (dashboards, real-time apps, component libraries) where missing cleanup creates the most impact
2. **Event-driven workload** — Repos that rely on listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, and background workers where leaks commonly originate
3. **Production maturity** — Active projects with ≥500 GitHub stars, ensuring community-validated, production-grade code
4. **Framework verification** — Confirmed presence of `.tsx`, `.vue`, or Angular decorator files to avoid backend-only or tooling repos
5. **Use-case diversity** — Balanced across domains (admin panels, CMS, component libraries, dashboards, dev tools) to capture different leak patterns

**Sample composition:**

- 210 React repositories (42%)
- 150 Vue repositories (30%)
- 140 Angular repositories (28%)

The sample includes major projects like Kibana, Next.js, Element Plus, and AFFiNE — codebases with millions of users and active development. This isn’t a random sample of all GitHub repos; it’s a curated set of high-impact projects where findings represent patterns in real production code.

### The numbers

**714,217 files scanned. 55,864 missing-cleanup patterns found. 430 out of 500 repos had at least one.**

That’s an **86.0% prevalence rate**.

Across 500 well-known, actively maintained open-source projects — from Next.js to Kibana to Element Plus — only 70 repos came back completely clean.

### By framework

| Framework | Issues | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **React** | 34,787 | 62.3% |
| **Vue** | 15,750 | 28.2% |
| **Angular** | 5,327 | 9.5% |

React dominates raw count, and the sample was also weighted toward React (210 repos vs 150 Vue and 140 Angular). The more useful lens is pattern distribution — which types of missing cleanup appear most often, regardless of framework.

### Which leak patterns?

| Pattern Type | Count | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing timer cleanup | 24,538 | 43.9% |
| Missing event listener removal | 10,616 | 19.0% |
| Missing subscription cleanup | 7,740 | 13.9% |
| Missing effect cleanup | 5,200 | 9.3% |
| Missing watch stop handle | 3,989 | 7.1% |
| Missing lifecycle cleanup | 1,641 | 2.9% |
| Missing RAF cancel | 1,230 | 2.2% |
| Missing observer disconnect | 787 | 1.4% |
| Missing renderer unlisten | 123 | 0.2% |

**Timers are the number one offender.** Nearly half of all findings are `setTimeout` or `setInterval` without cleanup. Timers are easy to forget because they’re invisible — you set one up, the feature works, and unless the delay is short enough to cause a visible side effect, you never notice the callback is still pending after unmount.

Event listeners are second at 10,616 instances. `addEventListener` without `removeEventListener` is the textbook example of a JavaScript memory leak, and it’s still pervasive across production codebases.

### Which specific setup calls?

| Setup Call | Count | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setTimeout` | 22,384 | 40.1% |
| `addEventListener` | 10,616 | 19.0% |
| `watch` | 3,360 | 6.0% |
| `useEffect(addEventListener)` | 2,165 | 3.9% |
| `requestAnimationFrame` | 1,764 | 3.2% |
| `setInterval` | 1,620 | 2.9% |
| `useEffect(setTimeout)` | 1,276 | 2.3% |
| `watchEffect` | 629 | 1.1% |

`setTimeout` alone accounts for 40% of all findings: 22,384 instances inside component code without a corresponding `clearTimeout` on unmount. The `useEffect(addEventListener)` pattern — an `addEventListener` placed *inside* a `useEffect` with no cleanup return — appears 2,165 times. In those cases the developer chose the right hook but omitted the most important part: the cleanup function.

### Where does the leaking code live?

| Context | Count | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Component lifecycle** | 18,406 | 32.9% |
| **Event binding** | 13,680 | 24.5% |
| **Timer** | 12,650 | 22.6% |
| **Store subscription** | 5,470 | 9.8% |
| **Service singleton** | 3,692 | 6.6% |
| **Unknown** | 1,966 | 3.5% |

A third of all findings sit directly in component lifecycle code — `useEffect`, `onMounted`, `ngOnInit`. This is the highest-impact location because lifecycle code runs on every mount and unmount. Each route change, conditional render, or tab switch creates and destroys components. When each destruction leaks a reference chain, the heap grows linearly with user navigation.

The unknown bucket is small (3.5%), significantly lower than in the blocking-io study. Frontend framework code follows more predictable structural patterns, which makes context classification more reliable.

### The biggest offenders

| Repository | Framework | Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| elastic/kibana | React | 1,796 |
| dcloudio/uni-app | Vue | 1,218 |
| microsoft/playwright | React | 1,104 |
| vercel/next.js | React | 1,103 |
| ever-co/ever-gauzy | Angular | 1,071 |
| didi/cube-ui | Vue | 970 |
| toeverything/AFFiNE | React | 887 |
| bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton | React | 728 |
| ElemeFE/element | Vue | 720 |
| posthog/posthog | React | 662 |

Raw count doesn’t equal raw risk — Kibana is a massive codebase where a high absolute count may reflect average *density* rather than unusual negligence. That said, several of these projects serve users in long-lived sessions where leaks compound most aggressively: **Kibana** (analytics dashboards open for hours), **AFFiNE** (collaborative workspace with frequent navigation), **BigBlueButton** (video conferencing sessions lasting hours), **PostHog** (analytics dashboards with live polling subscriptions).

### Severity breakdown

| Severity | Count | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High** | 19,115 | 34.2% |

High-severity covers patterns in component lifecycle hooks, subscription chains without cleanup, and listeners/timers in contexts where they accumulate — particularly when multiple instances stack per component.

### Framework ecosystem analysis

React’s 62.3% share of findings reflects both market dominance and architectural characteristics. The `useEffect` hook’s flexible cleanup model enables sophisticated patterns but requires explicit cleanup returns — and that’s easy to forget. A developer writes `useEffect(() => { addEventListener(...) }, [])`, the component works perfectly, and unless they think about the unmount path, the cleanup never gets added.

Vue’s reactivity system shows a different pattern. The `watch()` and `watchEffect()` APIs return stop handles, but the return value is optional — the watcher works fine even if you don’t capture it. This makes it easy to write `watch(source, callback)` and move on. The static analysis found 3,360 instances of `watch` with an unstored stop handle and 629 of `watchEffect`. That’s nearly 4,000 potential leak sites from just this one Vue-specific pattern.

**Tooling gap:** Framework-specific linting support varies widely:

- **React:** `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` catches missing dependencies but *not* missing cleanup returns. A `useEffect` with `addEventListener` and no cleanup passes linting.
- **Vue:** No official ESLint rule for unstored watch stop handles. The Vue DevTools can show active watchers, but won’t flag the missing cleanup in code review.

This tooling gap explains why these patterns persist at scale. The ecosystem provides partial coverage, but the most common leak patterns slip through.

---

## Part 2: What does missing cleanup actually cost?

Static analysis tells you *where* potential leaks live. The question that matters for engineering decisions: how much memory does each pattern actually retain?

### The setup

Each scenario simulates a component lifecycle in Node.js:

1. **Mount** — create component, allocate state (1,000-element number array), register resource
2. **Unmount** — BAD: do nothing; GOOD: deregister resource, clear state
3. **Repeat** 100 cycles, snapshot (with forced GC) every 10 cycles
4. **Repeat** entire run 50 times for mean and standard deviation

We force `global.gc()` before every snapshot (Node.js with `--expose-gc`), measuring *retained* memory — objects GC was told to collect but *can’t* because they’re still reachable.

**Environment:** Node.js v24.11.0, Windows x64, `--expose-gc`. Each scenario ran 50 independent times to establish statistical confidence.

#### Benchmark calibration methodology

The 1,000-element array size was chosen through a calibration sweep designed to optimize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):

**Calibration process:**

1. Tested array sizes: 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000 elements
2. Ran 50 cycles for each size with both BAD and GOOD variants
3. Calculated SNR as `|BAD growth - GOOD growth| / |GOOD growth|`
4. Evaluated growth rates (target: 0.5-5 MB/min for realistic session modeling)

**Results:**

- **500 elements:** SNR = 2.1 (acceptable but noisy)
- **1,000 elements:** SNR = 5.3 (excellent signal clarity)
- **2,500 elements:** SNR = 7.8 (higher signal but diminishing returns)
- **5,000 elements:** SNR = 12.4 (maximum clarity but unrealistic growth rate)

The calibration methodology is documented in `calibrate-sizes.ts` and replicable on other hardware configurations.

### SC1: React useEffect — event listener without cleanup

The textbook React memory leak. A component registers an event listener on a shared emitter (simulating `window`) inside `useEffect` without returning a cleanup function.

**Bad:** `window.addEventListener('resize', handler)` — handler closure references component state; listener persists after unmount.
**Good:** Same setup, but cleanup return calls `removeEventListener` and clears state.

| Metric | BAD (50 runs) | GOOD (50 runs) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean heap growth** | 807.2 KB | 2.4 KB | **804.8 KB** |
| **Std deviation** | ± 36.8 KB | ± 0.3 KB | ± 36.8 KB |
| **Rate** | 8.07 KB/cycle | 0.02 KB/cycle | 8.05 KB/cycle |

After 100 cycles, the bad variant accumulated ~0.8 MB of retained heap. The good variant: 2.4 KB total — not per cycle, *total*. That’s noise-floor jitter.

The standard deviation is tight: ± 37 KB across 50 runs. This is not a flaky measurement — the leak is deterministic and linear.

**What’s happening mechanically:** Each cycle creates a component holding ~8 KB of state (1,000 Float64 elements × 8 bytes), registers a listener on the shared emitter, then “unmounts” without removing it. The emitter’s listener array grows by one entry per cycle, and each entry’s closure keeps its component alive. After 100 cycles: 100 retained components × ~8 KB ≈ 800 KB. The arithmetic matches the measurement.

### SC2: Vue onMounted — timer without onUnmounted cleanup

A Vue component sets up a `setInterval` in `onMounted` without clearing it in `onUnmounted`. The timer callback’s closure references component data.

**Bad:** `setInterval(handler, 86_400_000)` — long-delay timer holds reference chain alive; never fires during measurement.
**Good:** `onUnmounted` calls `clearInterval(timerId)` and clears data.

| Metric | BAD (50 runs) | GOOD (50 runs) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean heap growth** | 819.1 KB | 2.6 KB | **816.5 KB** |
| **Std deviation** | ± 3.2 KB | ± 1.5 KB | ± 2.0 KB |
| **Rate** | 8.19 KB/cycle | 0.03 KB/cycle | 8.17 KB/cycle |

Nearly identical profile to SC1, despite a completely different retention mechanism (timer registry vs event listener list). The cost is the same because the underlying pattern is the same: a closure keeps component state reachable.

**Why a 24-hour delay?** The timer never fires during the benchmark. Retention comes from the *pending callback reference*, not from callback execution. This isolates the memory signal from CPU and execution noise.

| Metric | BAD (50 runs) | GOOD (50 runs) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean heap growth** | 803.8 KB | 2.6 KB | **801.2 KB** |
| **Std deviation** | ± 0.6 KB | ± 1.2 KB | ± 1.0 KB |
| **Rate** | 8.04 KB/cycle | 0.03 KB/cycle | 8.01 KB/cycle |

### SC4: Vue watch/watchEffect — stop handle not captured

A Vue component calls `watch()` or `watchEffect()` without storing the returned stop handle. The watcher registry holds the callback alive.

**Bad:** `watcher.watch(callback)` — return value discarded; registry holds callback → component.
**Good:** Stores stop handle, calls it on unmount, clears data.

| Metric | BAD (50 runs) | GOOD (50 runs) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean heap growth** | 810.1 KB | 2.5 KB | **807.6 KB** |
| **Std deviation** | ± 1.1 KB | ± 0.5 KB | ± 1.0 KB |
| **Rate** | 8.10 KB/cycle | 0.03 KB/cycle | 8.08 KB/cycle |

The BAD variant’s standard deviation is ± 1.1 KB — the most consistent measurement in the suite. The watcher registry produces near-perfectly linear heap growth.

**This is a Vue-specific anti-pattern** that’s easy to miss because `watch()` and `watchEffect()` function correctly without capturing their return value. The watcher fires, the reactivity system responds, the component behaves as expected. But the old watcher from the previous component instance is never disposed. Each mount stacks a new watcher on top of the previous ones.

Our scan found 3,360 instances of `watch` with an unstored stop handle and 629 of `watchEffect` — nearly 4,000 potential leak sites from this one pattern alone.

### SC5: requestAnimationFrame — without cancelAnimationFrame

A component requests an animation frame without cancelling it on unmount. Simulated with long-delay `setTimeout` in Node.js (the pending callback holds the reference chain alive, just as a pending RAF would in a browser).

**Bad:** `requestAnimationFrame(callback)` — pending frame holds closure → component → data.
**Good:** Stores frame ID, calls `cancelAnimationFrame(id)` on unmount, clears data.

| Metric | BAD (50 runs) | GOOD (50 runs) | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean heap growth** | 819.0 KB | 2.5 KB | **816.5 KB** |
| **Std deviation** | ± 3.1 KB | ± 1.2 KB | ± 2.9 KB |
| **Rate** | 8.19 KB/cycle | 0.03 KB/cycle | 8.16 KB/cycle |

Common in animation-heavy components — carousels, scroll-linked effects, canvas renderers, physics simulations. The scan found 1,230 instances of missing RAF cancel.

In a real browser, a leaked RAF is arguably worse than a leaked timer. RAF callbacks fire at display refresh rate — typically 60 fps. A leaked recursive chain (`requestAnimationFrame(function loop() { ... requestAnimationFrame(loop) })`) executes every 16.7 ms, holds references indefinitely, *and* burns CPU. It’s a memory leak and a performance regression in one.

## The full picture

| Scenario | Framework | BAD (KB ± std) | GOOD (KB ± std) | Delta (KB ± std) | Rate (KB/cycle) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SC1: useEffect listener | React | 807 ± 37 | 2.4 ± 0.3 | **805 ± 37** | 8.05 |
| SC2: onMounted timer | Vue | 819 ± 3 | 2.6 ± 1.5 | **817 ± 2** | 8.17 |
| SC4: watch stop handle | Vue | 810 ± 1.1 | 2.5 ± 0.5 | **808 ± 1** | 8.08 |
| SC5: RAF cancel | Cross-fw | 819 ± 3.1 | 2.5 ± 1.2 | **817 ± 3** | 8.16 |

*All values: mean ± std across 50 independent runs, forced GC, 100 cycles.*

**Key observations:**

- **BAD variants cluster tightly around 810 KB** across all five mechanisms after 100 cycles
- **GOOD variants remain at 2–3 KB total** — indistinguishable from zero at this scale
- **All five patterns leak at ~8 KB/cycle** — the mechanism differs (event target, timer registry, observable, watcher, pending RAF), but the cost is determined by payload size, not mechanism
- **Near-perfect linearity:** All five BAD variants grow at ~8 KB/cycle with minimal deviation, confirming the leak is deterministic, not probabilistic
- **Flat baseline:** GOOD variants show minimal noise-floor jitter (~2.5 KB total over 100 cycles) — this is GC overhead and measurement noise, not retained memory

The contrast is unambiguous: BAD variants accumulate 800+ KB while GOOD variants stay under 3 KB. The leak doesn’t happen probabilistically — it occurs on every single cycle, with near-identical magnitude.

### Statistical validation

Fifty independent runs per scenario provide enough data to quantify both measurement reliability and the magnitude of the cleanup effect.

**Confidence intervals (95% CI) for leak rates:**

| Scenario | Leak Rate (KB/cycle) | 95% CI | Coefficient of Variation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| React useEffect | 8.07 | ± 0.72 | 0.9% |
| Vue onMounted | 8.19 | ± 0.06 | 0.08% |
| Vue watch | 8.10 | ± 0.02 | 0.02% |
| RAF cancel | 8.19 | ± 0.06 | 0.08% |

*95% CI calculated as ± 1.96 × (std / √50). Coefficient of variation = std / mean.*

**Effect size:** All five scenarios showed extremely large effect sizes when comparing BAD vs GOOD variants. Using Cohen’s d:

- React useEffect: d = 21.8 (BAD mean 807 KB, GOOD mean 2.4 KB, pooled std 26.0 KB)
- Vue onMounted: d = 328.7 (BAD mean 819 KB, GOOD mean 2.6 KB, pooled std 2.5 KB)
- Vue watch: d = 828.5 (BAD mean 810 KB, GOOD mean 2.5 KB, pooled std 0.97 KB)
- RAF cancel: d = 281.7 (BAD mean 819 KB, GOOD mean 2.5 KB, pooled std 2.9 KB)

For reference, Cohen’s d > 0.8 is conventionally labeled “large.” Values above 20 mean the BAD and GOOD distributions have zero overlap — every single BAD run retained more memory than every single GOOD run. **The presence or absence of cleanup is not a marginal factor. It is the dominant variable in retained memory.**

**Statistical significance:** All scenarios showed p < 0.001 (Welch’s t-test, two-tailed). With 50 repeats and effect sizes this large, statistical power exceeds 99.99%. Put differently: if cleanup truly had no effect on memory retention, the probability of observing results this extreme would be less than 1 in 10,000.

**Measurement reliability:** The standard error of the mean (SEM = std / √50) was:

- React useEffect: 5.2 KB (0.6% of measured effect)
- Vue onMounted: 0.45 KB (0.06% of measured effect)
- Vue watch: 0.14 KB (0.02% of measured effect)
- RAF cancel: 0.41 KB (0.05% of measured effect)

With SEM below 1% of the measured effect for all five scenarios, the ~8 KB/cycle leak rate is a stable, reproducible measurement — not an artifact of variance or environment.

### What 8 KB/cycle means in practice

| Navigation Cycles | 1 Leaking Pattern | 3 Stacked | 5 Stacked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 50 | 0.4 MB | 1.2 MB | 2.0 MB |
| 100 | 0.8 MB | 2.4 MB | 4.0 MB |
| 200 | 1.6 MB | 4.8 MB | 8.0 MB |
| 500 | 4.0 MB | 12.0 MB | 20.0 MB |

**Mobile limits:** iOS Safari kills tabs at roughly 80-120 MB. Android Chrome: 150-300 MB. A dashboard with 3 leaking patterns hitting 12 MB in a moderate session is within range of the OS killing the tab.

**Electron apps:** Long-running desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord) are especially vulnerable. Users keep them open for hours. Even a single 8 KB/cycle leak over thousands of component mounts across a workday grows to tens of megabytes.

### Real-world impact scenarios

The ~8 KB/cycle figure is specific to our benchmark payload (1,000-element array ≈ 8 KB). Real component state varies, but the linear accumulation model holds. Here’s what it looks like in practice:

**Scenario 1: E-commerce product browsing**

A user browses 50 products in a shopping session. Each product detail page mounts a component with image carousel, reviews panel, and related products. If the component has three unhandled patterns — a resize listener for responsive layout, a polling timer for inventory updates, and a store subscription for cart state:

- Memory cost: 50 cycles × 3 patterns × 8 KB = **1.2 MB retained**
- On a mobile device with 2 GB RAM: 0.06% per session
- After 10 similar sessions without closing the tab: **12 MB retained**

For a user who keeps their shopping session open across multiple stores and tabs, this compounds. On iOS Safari, the 80-120 MB tab-kill threshold becomes reachable.

**Scenario 2: Dashboard with real-time updates**

A monitoring dashboard user switches between 5 different views (metrics, logs, alerts, infrastructure, billing) every 30 seconds during an incident. Session length: 30 minutes = 60 view switches. Each view has two unhandled patterns — a WebSocket subscription for live data and a timer for auto-refresh:

- Memory cost: 60 cycles × 2 patterns × 8 KB = **960 KB retained**
- Combined with other browser tabs (Slack, docs, Jira): can trigger browser tab throttling or freezing

The dashboard feels sluggish after 20 minutes. The user blames the server, but it’s the client leaking memory on every view switch.

**Scenario 3: SaaS admin panel (enterprise use)**

A power user keeps an admin panel open 8 hours/day, managing users, reviewing analytics, configuring settings. They navigate between sections 200 times per day. If five different sections each have 1-2 unhandled patterns (timers, listeners, subscriptions):

- Memory cost per day: 200 cycles × 1.5 patterns avg × 8 KB = **2.4 MB/day**
- Over a 5-day work week: **12 MB retained**
- Compounds across multiple browser tabs and windows

For Electron-based apps (VS Code, Slack, Figma), users often keep the app open for weeks without restart. Even small per-cycle leaks accumulate to hundreds of megabytes over that timespan.

**Scenario 4: Video conferencing / collaboration tool**

A 2-hour meeting with a collaboration tool that has a participant grid, chat panel, and shared whiteboard. Each participant join/leave event mounts/unmounts a video tile component. With 8 participants joining and leaving throughout the meeting (e.g., people dropping in and out), and each tile having 3 unhandled patterns (RAF for video rendering, canvas context listeners, media stream subscriptions):

- Memory cost: 8 cycles × 3 patterns × 8 KB = **192 KB retained**

Seems small in isolation, but video rendering state is typically much larger than our 1,000-element benchmark array. If real per-cycle cost is 10× higher, that’s nearly 2 MB per meeting. A user attending 4–5 meetings daily accumulates 8–10 MB.

**The threshold to watch:** Mobile browsers aggressively kill tabs above 1.5–2 GB. Desktop thresholds are higher (4–8 GB depending on available RAM) but reachable with extended sessions across multiple leaking tabs.

### How scan findings map to benchmarks

| Scan Pattern | Instances | Benchmark | Confirmed Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `missing_timer_cleanup` | 24,538 | SC2 (onMounted timer) | 8.17 KB/cycle |

## When missing cleanup is acceptable (and when it’s not)

Not every finding represents a production bug. Context determines impact.

**Generally safe:**

- **Singletons that mount once.** A root-level component that creates a `ResizeObserver` and never unmounts. One observer for the app lifetime — no accumulation.
- **Short-lived timers.** A `setTimeout` with a 100 ms delay in a component that lives for seconds. The callback fires and releases before the next mount.

**Dangerous:**

- **Frequently mounted components.** Route-level views, list items, modals, tab contents. Each cycle without cleanup accumulates another retained reference chain.
- **Long-lived sessions.** Dashboards, editors, chat apps. At 8 KB/cycle × 200 navigations × 3 patterns, that’s 4.8 MB retained in one session.

**The grey zone:**

- **Rarely mounted components.** A settings panel opened once per session. The leak exists but accumulation is negligible.
- **Self-cancelling timers.** A polling `setInterval` that clears itself after receiving a response. Static analysis flags it, but the runtime leak is bounded and short-lived.

## How to find this in your own codebase

Three approaches, ordered from fastest to most thorough.

**Framework-specific grep.** Quick, imprecise, but useful for a first pass:

```
# React: useEffect without cleanup return
grep -rn "useEffect(" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "return"

# Vue: onMounted without onUnmounted
for f in $(grep -rl "onMounted" src/ --include="*.vue" --include="*.ts"); do
  grep -L "onUnmounted" "$f" && echo "MISSING: $f"
done

done
```

These are crude heuristics — they’ll flag singletons and self-completing observables as false positives. But they’re fast and catch the obvious cases in under five minutes.

**Use AST-based static analysis.** Tools like [Code Evolution Lab](https://codeevolutionlab.com) walk the syntax tree, understand scope and lifecycle hooks, and match setup calls against cleanup calls. Significantly less noise than text-based grep.

**Monitor heap growth in production.** For deployed browser apps:

```
if (performance.memory) {
  setInterval(() => {
    const mb = (performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1);
    console.log(`JS Heap: ${mb} MB`);
  }, 60_000);
}
```

If the heap grows steadily wit
