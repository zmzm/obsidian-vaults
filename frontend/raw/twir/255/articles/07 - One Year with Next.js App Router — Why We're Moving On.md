# Item 7: One Year with Next.js App Router — Why We're Moving On

Source: [https://paperclover.net/blog/webdev/one-year-next-app-router](https://paperclover.net/blog/webdev/one-year-next-app-router)

Summary:
A developer shares their team's frustrations with Next.js App Router and React Server Components after a year of professional use, citing fundamental design disagreements and real-world pitfalls. Issues include the difficulty of optimistic updates, redundant data fetching, restrictive layouts, and dissatisfaction with Turbopack. The article details the migration process to TanStack Start and highlights what worked well in Next.js (e.g., next/metadata).

Key takeaways:
- Critiques focus on architectural pain points: optimistic updates, navigation, layout restrictions, and double data downloads.
- Migration to TanStack Start is presented as a smoother, more flexible alternative.
- Some Next.js features (next/metadata, next/og) are praised despite overall dissatisfaction.
- Useful for teams experiencing similar pain points or evaluating alternatives to Next.js.

# One Year with Next.js App Router - Why We're Moving On

As I’ve been using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) professionally on my employer’s web app, I find the core design of their App Router and [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) (RSC) to be extremely frustrating. And it’s not small bugs or that the API is confusing, but large disagreements about the fundamental design decisions that Vercel and the React team made when building it.

The more webdev events I go to, the more I see people who dislike Next.js, but still get stuck using it. By the end of this article, I will share how me and my colleagues escaped this hell, seamlessly migrating our entire frontend to [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest).

## [§](#toc)A Technical Review: What are Server Components?

The pitch of RSC is that components are put into two categories, **“server”** components and **“client”** components. Server components don’t have `useState`, `useEffect`, but can be `async function`s and refer to backend tools like directly calling into a database. Client components are the existing model, where there is code on the backend to generate HTML text and frontend code to manage the DOM using `window.document.*`.

> The first disaster: naming!! React is now using the wors **“server”** and **“client”** to refer to a very specific things, ignoring their existing definitions. This would be fine, except **Client** components can run on the backend too! In this article, I’ll be using the terms **“backend”** and **“frontend”** to describe the two execution environments that web apps exist in: a Node.js process and a Web browser, respectively.

This **Server**/**Client** component model is interesting. Since built-ins like `<Suspense />` get serialized across the network, data fetching can be very trivially modeled with async **server components**, and the fallback UI works as if it were client-side.

src/app/[username]/page.tsx

```
export default async function Page({ params }) {
    const { username } = await params;

    return <main>
        <UserInfo username={username} />

        <Suspense fallback={<PostListSkeleton />}>
            <UserPostList username={username} />
        </Suspense>
    </main>
}

async function UserInfo({ username }) {
    const user = await fetchUserInfo(username);
    return <>
        <h1>{user.displayName}</h1>
        {user.bio ? <Markdown content={user.bio} /> : ""}
    </>
}

async function UserPostList({ username }) {
    const posts = await fetchUserPostList(username);
    return ;
}
```

If we ignore the 40kB gzipped bundle size of React itself, the above example has zero JavaScript for the UI and data fetching — it just streams the markup! For example, the imagined markdown parser within the `<Markdown />` component stays on the backend. When an interactive frontend is needed, **Client components** can be created by putting them in a file starting with `“use client”`.

src/components/CopyButton.tsx

```
"use client"; export function CopyButton({ url }) {
    return <>
        <span>{url}</span>
        <button onClick={() => {
            const full = new URL(url, location.href);
            navigator.clipboard.writeText(full.href);
            }}>copy</button>
    </>
}
```

src/app/q+a/Card.tsx

```
export function Card() {
    return <article>
        <header>
            {}
            <CopyButton url="/q+a/2506010139" />
        </header>
        <p>
            {}
            <Markdown content=".........." />
        </p>
    </article>
}
```

## [§](#toc)Real-world Pitfalls of the App Router

After quitting [Bun](https://bun.com) as a runtime engineer (I implemented [Server Components bundling](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/67f0c3e016aa479738469adac2b79a1862b88122/src/bake/bake.d.ts) and [a RSC template](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/tree/e7790894d92b730758ecadf971cb935063508dfb/src/bake/bun-framework-react) there), I joined a small company working on the front lines: a Next.js app with a Hono backend. The following notes are simplifications from the real world problems I’ve encountered when trying to maintain and develop new features. As a result of all of these, everyone’s time is wasted either working around design flaws, or explaining to each other why what should be a non-issue is an immovable object.

### [§](#toc)Optimistic Updates are Impossible

The Next.js documentation for performing mutations [does not mention optimistic updates](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data); it appears this case was not thought about. Components rendered by the **React Server**, by design, can not be modified after mounting. Elements that could change need to be inside a client component, but data fetching cannot happen on the client components, even during SSR on the backend. This results in awkwardly small server components that only do data fetching and then have a client component that contains a mostly-static version of the page.

src/app/user/[username]/page.tsx

```
export default async function Page() {
    const user = await fetchUserInfo(username);
    return <ProfileLayout>
        <UserProfile user={user} />
    </ProfileLayout>;
}
```

src/app/user/[username]/UserProfile.tsx

```
"use client"; export function UserProfile({ user: initialUser }) {
    const [user, optimisticUpdateUser] = useState(initialUser);

    async function onEdit(newUser) {
        optimisticUpdateUser(newUser);
        const resp = await fetch("...", {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify(newUser),
            ... })
        if (!resp.ok) }

    return <main>{}</main>:
}
```

As more of the page needs interactivity, it gets messier trying to keep the static parts truly server-side. On the work app, nearly every piece of UI displays some dynamic data. A [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) synchronizes data live as it updates (for example, a user card’s online state along with their basic profile). Since these component setups are harder to understand and maintain for engineers, almost all of our pages are entirely `“use client”` with a `page.tsx` that defines the data fetching.

A more concrete example of what this looks like in practice with the data-fetching library we use at work, [TanStack Query](https://github.com/tanstack/query#readme).

src/queries/users.ts

```
export const queryUserInfo = (username) => ({
    queryKey: ['user', username],
    queryFn: async ({ ... }) => });
```

src/app/user/[username]/page.tsx

```
export default async function Page({ params }) {
    const { username } = await params;

    const queryClient = new QueryClient();
    await queryClient.ensureQueryData(queryUserInfo(username));

    return <HydrationBoundary state={dehydrate(queryClient)}>
        <ClientPage />
    </HydrationBoundary>;
}
```

src/app/user/[username]/ClientPage.tsx

```
"use client";
export function ClientPage() {
    const { username } = useParams();
    const { data: user } = useSuspenseQuery(queryUserInfo(username));

    return <main>
        {}
    </main>;
}
```

This example has to be three separate files because of the rules of server component bundling. (The client component needs `“use client”`, and server component files often can’t be imported on the client due to server-only imports.). In the Pages router, this could’ve been a single file because of the tree-shaking that `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` has.

### [§](#toc)Every Navigation is Another Fetch

Since the App Router starts every page as a server component, with (ideally) small areas of interactivity, a navigation to a new page *has* to fetch the Next.js server, regardless of what data the client already has available! Even with a a `loading.tsx` file, opening `/`, navigating to `/other`, and then going back to `/` will show the loading state while it re-fetches the homepage.

The only case this works is for **perfectly static content**, where instant navigations and prefetching work great. But **web apps are not static**, they have lots of dynamic content. Being logged in affects the homepage, which is infuriating because the client literally has everything needed to display the page instantly. It’s not like the cookies changed.

> **aside**: In further testing on a blank project, I observe cases where the Next frontend code would pre-fetch routes, but **without any real contents**. On the hello world example, this was a 1.8kB RSC payload that pointed to 2 different JS chunks 4 separate times. This is just pure waste of our bandwidth and egress, especially considering all of this information is re-fetched when I actually click the link.

The solution to this appears to be [`staleTime`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/staleTimes), but it’s marked experimental and “not recommended for production”. The fact this is a non-default afterthought configuration option is embarrassing. Even if we used it, you cannot make multiple pages that refer to the same underlying data share any of it.

One form of loading state that cannot be represented with the App Router is having a page such as a page like a git project’s issue page, and clicking on a user name to navigate to their profile page. With `loading.tsx`, the entire page is a skeleton, but when modeling these queries with TanStack Query it is possible to show the username and avatar instantly while the user’s bio and repositories are fetched in. Server components don’t support this form of navigation because the data is only available in rendered components, so it must be re-fetched.

In our Next.js site, we have this line of code on our server component data fetchers to make soft navigations faster by skipping the data fetch phase all together.

src/util/tanstack-query-helpers.server.ts

```
export function serverSidePrefetchQueries(queries) {
    if ((await headers()).get("next-url")) {
        return;
    }
    }
```

In addition to this, `loading.tsx` should contain the `useQuery` calls so that while the network request for the empty RSC happens, the data is being fetched if it actually is needed. In fact, the `loading.tsx` state can just be the actual client component, and you’ll see the client page.

src/app/user/[username]/loading.tsx

```
"use client";
export default function PageLoadingSkeleton() {
    return <ClientPage />;
}
```

> At work, we just make our `loading.tsx` files contain the `useQuery` calls and show a skeleton. This is because when Next.js loads the actual Server Component, no matter what, the entire page re-mounts. No VDOM diffing here, meaning all hooks (`useState`) will reset slightly after the request completes. I tried to reproduce a simple case where I was *begging* Next.js to just *update the existing DOM* and preserve state, but it just doesn’t. Thankfully, the time the blank RSC call takes is short enough.

### [§](#toc)Layouts are Artificially Restricted

Layouts can perform data fetching, but they can’t observe or alter the request in any way. This is done so that Next.js can fetch and cache layouts whenever they want. In every other framework, layouts are just regular components that have no feature difference compared to page components.

Fetching layouts in isolation is a cute idea, but it ends up being silly because it also means that any data fetching has to be re-done per layout. You can’t share a `QueryClient`; instead, you must rely on their [monkey-patched `fetch`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) to cache the same `GET` request like they promise.

When a coworker asks me about why Next.js rejects some code, I’ve given up on explaining the technical intricacies and just say *“It’s a Next.js Skill Issue, I’m going to blow it up soon don’t worry.”* These rules are too hard for normal developers to understand.

### [§](#toc)You Still Download All the Content Twice

Unlike the [“Islands Architecture”](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/), Server Components still have to be hydrated on the frontend to support `Suspense` and preserving client component state. When doing soft navigations, the “RSC Payload” (which is not HTML at all) is retrieved by `fetch`. On a fresh reload, HTML is needed for the [first paint](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), but the information about Client components and `Suspense` is not contained within that HTML. React’s solution is to **send a second copy of the entire page’s markup**. An example of what a Next.js production server would send in a dynamic page render would be something like this:

GET /user/clover

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    {link and meta tags}
</head>
<body>
    {server side render}
    <script>
        (self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0])
    </script>
    <script>
        self.__next_f.push([1,"1:\"$Sreact.fragment\"\n2:I[658993,[\"/_next/st{...}"])
    </script>

    <div class="user-post-list">
        {server side render of a Suspense boundary}
    </div>
    <script>
        self.__next_f.push([2,"14:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h4\"{...}"])
    </script>

    </body>
</html>
```

This solution **doubles the size of the initial HTML payload**. Except it’s worse, because the RSC payload includes JSON quoted in JS string literals, which is a is much less efficient format than HTML. While it seems to compress fine with brotli and render fast in the browser, this is wasteful. With the hydration pattern, at least the data locally could be re-used for interactivity and other pages.

Even on pages that have little to no interactivity, you pay the cost. To use the Next.js documentation as an example, loading [its homepage](https://nextjs.org/docs) loads an page that is around 750kB (250kB of HTML and the 500kB of script tags), and content is in there twice.

You can verify that by pressing `Cmd` + `Opt` + `u` on Mac or `Ctrl` + `u` on other platforms. And then `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `f` to locate any string of the blog, such as “building full-stack web applications”. It’s there twice. And **there is no way around this**, since it’s a fundamental piece of React Server Components.

This RSC format certainly has more waste. But I really don’t feel like digging into why the string `/_next/static/chunks/6192a3719cda7dcc.js` appears 27 separate times. What the hell, guys? Is your bandwidth free???

### [§](#toc)Turbopack Sucks

This section is not constructive.

- Turbopack isn’t fast
- Turbopack emits code that is hard to debug in a debugger (in development mode)
- Turbopack throws bad error messages in many cases

I wouldn’t have given this point a section in the blog normally, but I want to point out three actual examples directly from the project.

The first is a place where during some refactoring to satisfy the Server/Client component models, I accidentally made a Client component `async`. This one was quite annoying because it didn’t say at all where the issue was, but only contained the **server** stack trace.

![Next.js error](/file/2025/blog-everyone-hates-nextjs/asyncerror.png)

Another case of a terrible error message:

![Next.js error](/file/2025/blog-everyone-hates-nextjs/nexterror.png)

> After fixing the underlying issue in this second error (which I cannot recall), the Dev server hung and had to be restarted to recover.

The final one is the dozen times I place a debugger breakpoint and the variable name `hello` gets turned into `__TURBOPACK__imported__module__$5b$project$5d2f$client$2f$src$2f$utils$2f$filename$2e$ts__$5b$app$2d$client$5d$__$28$ecmascript$29$__[“hello”]` and other bullshit.

Okay. This all sucks. What can we do?

## [§](#toc)Seamlessly Ditching Next.js and Vercel at Work

There are two types of web projects:

- A web site with mostly static content.
- A web app with majorly dynamic and interactive components.

And Next.js is the wrong tool for both of these jobs. If you’re in the first category with a static web site, go for [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/). For everyone who needs the full power of React, this section is about how I replaced the vendor locked Next with [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest), incrementally and seamlessly.

It started with this Vite config.

vite.config.ts

```
const config = defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
    const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), "NEXT_PUBLIC_");
    return {
        server: { port: 3000 },
        define: Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(env).map(
            ([k, v]) => [`process.env.${k}`, JSON.stringify(v)])),
        plugins: [
            viteTsConfigPaths({ projects: ["./tsconfig.json"] }),
            tailwindcss(),
            tanstackStart({
                router: { routesDirectory: "src/tanstack-routes" },
            }),
            viteReact(),
        ],
        resolve: {
            alias: { next: path.resolve("./src/tanstack-next/") },
            conditions: ["tanstack"],
            extensions: [
                ".tanstack.tsx", ".tanstack.ts",
                ".mjs", ".js", ".mts", ".ts",
                ".jsx", ".tsx", ".json",
            ],
        },
    };
});
```

Then, I looked for every usage of a Next.js API, and either removed it or made a stub for TanStack. For example, `src/tanstack-next/link.tsx` implements `next/link`:

src/tanstack-next/link.tsx

```
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { LinkProps } from "next/link";

export default function LinkAdapter({ href, ...rest }: LinkProps) {
  return <Link {...rest} to={href as unknown as any} />;
}
```

> Some of these stubs can be extremely simple. Starting out, my implementation of `useRouter` was just `return {}`, but later I had to add a couple methods to the object. The code here doesn’t have to be clean, because it is temporary.

Now, the new site can import nearly every client component by either stubbing out the Next.js APIs it needs, or by using the `.tanstack.ts` extension to re-implement logic on a file-by-file basis. And shortly after, I got the site’s homepage to work in TanStack Start, and we merged the branch.

![My “nextgate” PR](/file/2025/blog-everyone-hates-nextjs/pr.png)

> This first PR only supported one of our pages, and was able to do it in a thousand lines of added code, and 40 lines deleted. I had previous patches to remove the few uses of `next/image` and `next/font`.

What was left was porting every other route over. The one thing we lose in migrating from Next.js to any other framework is the ability to `await` data-fetching functions in the UI. In practice, moving every route into a `loader` function made it much more clear what happened when a page was SSR’d. For pages that had multiple fetches, these could be combined into a single, special API call that would return all of the relevant data for that page.

To re-iterate in bold font: **The migration path from Server Components is to just simplify your code — RSC inherently drives you down a chaotic road of things you do not need**. Nearly every complex part of our site got easier to understand for all engineers. The exception to this was having everyone get used to the new file system routing conventions. With enough examples, we all got the hang of it.

With the incremental migration in place, new code did not break the existing deployment. TanStack slowly took over the codebase, and we eventually deleted all of the Next.js stubs and gained all of the beautiful [type-safety features](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/guide/type-safety) that the TanStack Router provides. At the end, the site performed faster from every angle: Development Mode, Production page load times, Soft navigations, and at a lower price than our Next depoyment with Vercel.

In my opinion, this is one of the only good APIs Next.js has, and was the one place in our code where moving to TanStack made things harder to do. Instead of worsening the code, I just ported their metadata API into a regular function, so everyone can use it. Originally, I had a 1:1 port on NPM, but earlier this year I simplified it’s API into one short and understandable file. As of this blog post, I have added a TanStack-compatible `meta.toTags` API, which can be installed from [JSR](https://jsr.io/@clo/lib), [NPM](https://npmjs.com/@paperclover/lib), or simply copied into your project.

> **notice**: Due to time constraints with writing this article, the library has not yet been updated. I’ll probably get around to it by the ~~end of this week (Oct 24th)~~ some time soon… As a placeholder, I’m able to share the version that is used at work to my website: [`meta.tanstack.ts`](https://paperclover.net/file/2025/blog-everyone-hates-nextjs/meta.tanstack.ts).

```
import * as meta from "@clo/lib/meta";

export const defineHead = meta.toTags.bind(null, {
    base: new URL("https://paperclover.net"),
    titleTemplate: (title) => [title, "paper clover"]
        .filter(Boolean).join(' | '),
    });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/blog")({
    head: () =>
        defineHead({
            title: "clover's blog", description: "a catgirl meows about her technology viewpoints",
            canonical: "/blog", embed: {
                image: "/img/blog.webp",
            },

            extra: <>
                <meta name="site-verification" content="waffles" />,
            </>,
        }),

    component: Page,
});

function Page() {
    ...
}
```

My version wasn’t concerned with covering the entire space of Next.js’s metadata object, but instead uses inline JSX to fill that gap.

### [§](#toc)`next/og` is Good Too

No strong opinions. I just want to remind everyone that the `@vercel/og` package exists.

## [§](#toc)My Experience Feels like the Usual

At the Next.js Conf 2024, everyone there was raving about Server Components. I forget exactly who I talked to, but the big people were all in on this. I, having implemented the bundler end of RSC, saw a couple of the problems in the format. With Next 15 “stabilizing” the App Router last year, many companies are building their products on it, realizing these pitfalls first-hand.

I came into the Next.js game late, only starting in June with version 15. But everyone I’ve talked to at events sympathize with my notes. All the people I talked to on the subject at Bun’s 1.3 Party agreed with me. Even some people at Vercel told me they don’t like how Next.js is to actually use.

I hope as TanStack Start stabilizes, it becomes the Next.js replacement everyone wants.

A lot of in the JavaScript ecosystem is a mess. That mess is why web development gets made fun of. There were a lot of times I thought that working with the web was an unrecoverable mess, but the mess was actually just the commonly-used libraries I surrounded myself with. When that is peeled back, modern web development technologies are awesome.

I’ve been making this website from scratch without any framework since late 2024, by writing systems like my own [TUI progress widget](https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/lib/progress.ts), [static file proxy](https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/src/file-viewer/cache.ts), incremental build system, and many more components. Working on this code has produced some of my best coding sessions (by happiness) in years. The viewers of *[paper clover](https://paperclover.net/)* get a better quality website; the mini-libraries I create get [extracted for public use](https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/lib#readme), everyone wins.

This level of from-scratch is too much for most people, especially at the workplace. I say that at the minimum, we should only give our attention and money to high quality tools that respect us. And Next.js and the company behind it, Vercel, are not that.

If you use Next.js, and feel that the experience doesn’t remind you of respect too, consider whether you and your colleagues want to continue supporting their [serverless empire](https://youtu.be/SCIfWhAheVw). The Vite ecosystem seems pretty decent to build on right now, but I still have little experience in using their tools at scale in production. The [Vite+ launch from Void0](https://viteplus.dev/) seems interesting, but only time will tell if these venture-funded tools will respect us (end-users and developers) long term.

Next.js Conf 2025, as of writing, is [tomorrow](https://nextjs.org/conf). Instead of purchasing a $800 ticket, I decided to put that money [toward the TanStack team](https://github.com/sponsors/tannerlinsley) for [respecting and improving the web development ecosystem](https://tanstack.com/ethos).
