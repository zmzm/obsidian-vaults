# Item 1: Next.js 16

Source: [https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16)

Summary:
Next.js 16 introduces major features such as Cache Components (opt-in, explicit caching with "use cache"), stable Turbopack (default bundler), improved logging, a new proxy.ts for network boundaries, and support for React Compiler and React 19.2. The release focuses on performance, developer experience, and architectural clarity, with breaking changes to middleware and caching APIs. Migration is supported via codemods and an upgrade guide. Cache Components and Partial Pre-Rendering are now first-class, replacing previous experimental flags.

Key takeaways:
- Cache Components provide explicit, flexible caching using a "use cache" directive, completing the Partial Pre-Rendering story.
- Turbopack is now stable and default, offering significant build and refresh speed improvements; filesystem caching is in beta.
- proxy.ts replaces middleware.ts for Node.js network boundaries; Edge middleware is deprecated.
- Logging and build reporting are more granular; React Compiler and React 19.2 features (like View Transitions) are supported.
- Breaking changes require careful upgrade; automated and manual migration paths are available.

- [\*\*Enhanced Routing\*\*](#enhanced-routing-and-navigation): Optimized navigations and prefetching with layout deduplication and incremental prefetching
- [\*\*Improved Caching APIs\*\*](#improved-caching-apis): New `updateTag()` and refined `revalidateTag()`
- [\*\*React 19.2\*\*](#react-192-and-canary-features): View Transitions, `useEffectEvent()`, ``
- [\*\*Breaking Changes\*\*](#breaking-changes-and-other-updates): Async params, `next/image` defaults, and more
Upgrade to Next.js 16:
```bash filename="terminal"
# Use the automated upgrade CLI
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
# ...or upgrade manually
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
# ...or start a new project
npx create-next-app@latest
```
For cases where the codemod can't fully migrate your code, please read the [upgrade guide](/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16).
## New Features and Improvements
### Cache Components
Cache Components are a new set of features designed to make caching in Next.js both more explicit, and more flexible. They center around the new `"use cache"` directive, which can be used to cache pages, components, and functions, and which leverages the compiler to automatically generate cache keys wherever it’s used.
Unlike the implicit caching found in previous versions of the App Router, caching with Cache Components is entirely opt-in. All dynamic code in any page, layout, or API route is executed at request time by default, giving Next.js an out-of-the-box experience that’s better aligned with what developers expect from a full-stack application framework.
Cache Components also complete the story of Partial Prerendering (PPR), which was first introduced in 2023. Prior to PPR, Next.js had to choose whether to render each URL statically or dynamically; there was no middle ground. PPR eliminated this dichotomy, and let developers opt portions of their static pages into dynamic rendering (via Suspense) without sacrificing the fast initial load of fully static pages.
You can enable Cache Components in your `next.config.ts` file:
```ts filename="next.config.ts"
const nextConfig = {
cacheComponents: true,
};
export default nextConfig;
```
We will be sharing more about Cache Components and how to use them at [Next.js Conf 2025](https://nextjs.org/conf) on October 22nd, and we will be sharing more content in our blog and documentation in the coming weeks.
> \*\*Note:\*\* as previously announced in the beta release, the previous experimental `experimental.ppr` flag and configuration options have been removed in favor of the Cache Components configuration.
Learn more in the documentation [here](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents).
### Next.js Devtools MCP
Next.js 16 introduces \*\*Next.js DevTools MCP\*\*, a Model Context Protocol integration for AI-assisted debugging with contextual insight into your application.
The Next.js DevTools MCP provides AI agents with:
- \*\*Next.js knowledge\*\*: Routing, caching, and rendering behavior
- \*\*Unified logs\*\*: Browser and server logs without switching contexts
- \*\*Automatic error access\*\*: Detailed stack traces without manual copying
- \*\*Page awareness\*\*: Contextual understanding of the active route
This enables AI agents to diagnose issues, explain behavior, and suggest fixes directly within your development workflow.
Learn more in the documentation [here](/docs/app/guides/mcp).
### `proxy.ts` (formerly `middleware.ts`)
`proxy.ts` replaces `middleware.ts` and makes the app’s network boundary explicit. `proxy.ts` runs on the Node.js runtime.
- \*\*What to do\*\*: Rename `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` and rename the exported function to `proxy`. Logic stays the same.
- \*\*Why\*\*: Clearer naming and a single, predictable runtime for request interception.
```ts filename="proxy.ts"
export default function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url));
}
```
> \*\*Note:\*\* The `middleware.ts` file is still available for Edge runtime use cases, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Learn more in the documentation [here](/docs/app/getting-started/proxy).
### Logging Improvements
In Next.js 16 the development request logs are extended showing where time is spent.
- Compile: Routing and compilation
- Render: Running your code and React rendering

![](/static/blog/next-16/development-log.jpg)

The build is also extended to show where time is spent. Each step in the build process is now shown with the time it took to complete.
```bash filename="terminal"
▲ Next.js 16 (Turbopack)
✓ Compiled successfully in 615ms
✓ Finished TypeScript in 1114ms
✓ Collecting page data in 208ms
✓ Generating static pages in 239ms
✓ Finalizing page optimization in 5ms
```

The following features were [previously](/blog/next-16-beta) announced in the beta release:
### Developer Experience
#### Turbopack (stable)
Turbopack has reached stability for both development and production builds, and is now the default bundler for all new Next.js projects. Since its beta release earlier this summer, adoption has scaled rapidly: more than 50% of development sessions and 20% of production builds on Next.js 15.3+ are already running on Turbopack.
With Turbopack, you can expect:
- 2–5× faster production builds
- Up to 10× faster Fast Refresh
We're making Turbopack the default to bring these performance gains to every Next.js developer, no configuration required. For apps with custom webpack setups, you can continue using webpack by running:
```bash filename="terminal"
next dev --webpack
next build --webpack
```
#### Turbopack File System Caching (beta)
Turbopack now supports filesystem caching in development, storing compiler artifacts on disk between runs for significantly faster compile times across restarts, especially in large projects.
Enable filesystem caching in your configuration:
```ts filename="next.config.ts"
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev: true,
},
};
export default nextConfig;
```
All internal Vercel apps are already using this feature, and we’ve seen notable improvements in developer productivity across large repositories.
We’d love to hear your feedback as we iterate on filesystem caching. Please try it out and share your experience.
#### Simplified `create-next-app`
`create-next-app` has been redesigned with a simplified setup flow, updated project structure, and improved defaults. The new template includes the App Router by default, TypeScript-first configuration, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
#### Build Adapters API (alpha)
Following the [Build Adapters RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77740), we've worked with the community and deployment platforms to deliver the first alpha version of the Build Adapters API.
Build Adapters allow you to create custom adapters that hook into the build process, enabling deployment platforms and custom build integrations to modify Next.js configuration or process build output.
```js filename="next.config.js"
const nextConfig = {
experimental: {
adapterPath: require.resolve('./my-adapter.js'),
},
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```
Share your feedback in the [RFC discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77740).
#### React Compiler Support (stable)
Built-in support for the React Compiler is now stable in Next.js 16 following the React Compiler's 1.0 release. The React Compiler automatically memoizes components, reducing unnecessary re-renders with zero manual code changes.
The `reactCompiler` configuration option has been promoted from `experimental` to stable. It is not enabled by default as we continue gathering build performance data across different application types. Expect compile times in development and during builds to be higher when enabling this option as the React Compiler relies on Babel.
```ts filename="next.config.ts"
const nextConfig = {
reactCompiler: true,
};
export default nextConfig;
```
Install the latest version of the React Compiler plugin:
```bash filename="terminal"
npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```
### Core Features & Architecture
#### Enhanced Routing and Navigation
Next.js 16 includes a complete overhaul of the routing and navigation system,
making page transitions leaner and faster.
\*\*Layout deduplication\*\*: When prefetching multiple URLs with a shared layout, the layout is downloaded once instead of separately for each Link. For example, a page with 50 product links now downloads the shared layout once instead of 50 times, dramatically reducing the network transfer size.
\*\*Incremental prefetching\*\*: Next.js only prefetches parts not already in cache, rather than entire pages. The prefetch cache now:
- Cancels requests when the link leaves the viewport
- Prioritizes link prefetching on hover or when re-entering the viewport
- Re-prefetches links when their data is invalidated
- Works seamlessly with upcoming features like Cache Components
\*\*Trade-off\*\*: You may see more individual prefetch requests, but with much lower total transfer sizes. We believe this is the right trade-off for nearly all applications. If the increased request count causes issues, please let us know. We're working on additional optimizations to inline data chunks more efficiently.
These changes require no code modifications and are designed to improve performance across all apps.
#### Improved Caching APIs
Next.js 16 introduces refined caching APIs for more explicit control over cache behavior.
##### `revalidateTag()` (updated)
`revalidateTag()` now requires a \*\*[`cacheLife` profile](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife#reference)\*\* as the second argument to enable stale-while-revalidate (SWR) behavior:
```ts
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';
// ✅ Use built-in cacheLife profile (we recommend 'max' for most cases)
revalidateTag('blog-posts', 'max');
// Or use other built-in profiles
revalidateTag('news-feed', 'hours');
revalidateTag('analytics', 'days');
// Or use an inline object with a custom revalidation time
revalidateTag('products', { expire: 3600 });
// ⚠️ Deprecated - single argument form
revalidateTag('blog-posts');
```
The profile argument accepts built-in `cacheLife` profile names (like `'max'`, `'hours'`, `'days'`) or [custom profiles](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife#defining-reusable-cache-profiles) defined in your `next.config`. You can also pass an inline `{ expire: number }` object. We recommend using `'max'` for most cases, as it enables background revalidation for long-lived content. When users request tagged content, they receive cached data immediately while Next.js revalidates in the background.
Use `revalidateTag()` when you want to invalidate only properly tagged cached entries with stale-while-revalidate behavior. This is ideal for static content that can tolerate eventual consistency.
> \*\*Migration guidance:\*\* Add the second argument with a `cacheLife` profile (we recommend `'max'`) for SWR behavior, or use `updateTag()` in Server Actions if you need read-your-writes semantics.
##### `updateTag()` (new)
`updateTag()` is a new Server Actions-only API that provides \*\*read-your-writes\*\* semantics, expiring and immediately reading fresh data within the same request:
```ts
'use server';
import { updateTag } from 'next/cache';
export async function updateUserProfile(userId: string, profile: Profile) {
await db.users.update(userId, profile);
// Expire cache and refresh immediately - user sees their changes right away
updateTag(`user-${userId}`);
}
```
This ensures interactive features reflect changes immediately. Perfect for forms, user settings, and any workflow where users expect to see their updates instantly.
##### `refresh()` (new)
`refresh()` is a new Server Actions-only API for refreshing \*\*uncached data only\*\*. It doesn't touch the cache at all:
```ts
'use server';
import { refresh } from 'next/cache';
export async function markNotificationAsRead(notificationId: string) {
// Update the notification in the database
await db.notifications.markAsRead(notificationId);
// Refresh the notification count displayed in the header
// (which is fetched separately and not cached)
refresh();
}
```
This API is complementary to the client-side `router.refresh()`. Use it when you need to refresh uncached data displayed elsewhere on the page after performing an action. Your cached page shells and static content remain fast while dynamic data like notification counts, live metrics, or status indicators refresh.
#### React 19.2 and Canary Features
The App Router in Next.js 16 uses the latest React [Canary release](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries), which includes the newly released React 19.2 features and other features being incrementally stabilized. Highlights include:
- \*\*[View Transitions](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition)\*\*: Animate elements that update inside a Transition or navigation
- \*\*[`useEffectEvent`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffectEvent)\*\*: Extract non-reactive logic from Effects into reusable Effect Event functions
- \*\*[Activity](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity)\*\*: Render "background activity" by hiding UI with `display: none` while maintaining state and cleaning up Effects
Learn more in the [React 19.2 announcement](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/01/react-19-2).

| \*\*`next/image` local src with query strings\*\* | Now requires `images.localPatterns` config to prevent enumeration attacks |
#### Behavior Changes
These features have new default behaviors in Next.js 16:
| Changed Behavior | Details |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \*\*Default bundler\*\* | Turbopack is now the default bundler for all apps; opt out with `next build --webpack` |
| \*\*`images.minimumCacheTTL` default\*\* | Changed from 60s to 4 hours (14400s); reduces revalidation cost for images without cache-control headers |
| \*\*`images.imageSizes` default\*\* | Removed `16` from default sizes (used by only 4.2% of projects); reduces srcset size and API variations |
| \*\*`images.qualities` default\*\* | Changed from `[1..100]` to `[75]`; `quality` prop is now coerced to closest value in `images.qualities` |
| \*\*`images.dangerouslyAllowLocalIP`\*\* | New security restriction blocks local IP optimization by default; set to `true` for private networks only |
| \*\*`images.maximumRedirects` default\*\* | Changed from unlimited to 3 redirects maximum; set to `0` to disable or increase for rare edge cases |
| \*\*`@next/eslint-plugin-next` default\*\* | Now defaults to ESLint Flat Config format, aligning with ESLint v10 which will drop legacy config support |
| \*\*Prefetch cache behavior\*\* | Complete rewrite with layout deduplication and incremental prefetching |
| \*\*`revalidateTag()` signature\*\* | Now requires `cacheLife` profile as second argument for stale-while-revalidate behavior |
| \*\*Babel configuration in Turbopack\*\* | Automatically enables Babel if a babel config is found (previously exited with hard error) |
| \*\*Terminal output\*\* | Redesigned with clearer formatting, better error messages, and improved performance metrics |
| \*\*Dev and build output directories\*\* | `next dev` and `next build` now use separate output directories, enabling concurrent execution |
| \*\*Lockfile behavior\*\* | Added lockfile mechanism to prevent multiple `next dev` or `next build` instances on the same project |
| \*\*Parallel routes `default.js`\*\* | All parallel route slots now require explicit `default.js` files; builds fail without them. Create `default.js` that calls `notFound()` or returns `null` for previous behavior |
| \*\*Modern Sass API\*\* | Bumped `sass-loader` to v16, which supports modern Sass syntax and new features |
#### Deprecations
These features are deprecated in Next.js 16 and will be removed in a future version:
| Deprecated | Details |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `middleware.ts` filename | Rename to `proxy.ts` to clarify network boundary and routing focus |
| `next/legacy/image` component | Use `next/image` instead for improved performance and features |
| `images.domains` config | Use `images.remotePatterns` config instead for improved security restriction |
| `revalidateTag()` single argument | Use `revalidateTag(tag, profile)` for SWR, or `updateTag(tag)` in Actions for read-your-writes |
#### Additional Improvements
- \*\*Performance improvements\*\*: Significant performance optimizations for `next dev` and `next start` commands
- \*\*Node.js native TypeScript for `next.config.ts`\*\*: Run `next dev`, `next build`, and `next start` commands with `--experimental-next-config-strip-types` flag to enable native TypeScript for `next.config.ts`.
We'll aim to share a more comprehensive migration guide ahead of the stable release in our documentation.
