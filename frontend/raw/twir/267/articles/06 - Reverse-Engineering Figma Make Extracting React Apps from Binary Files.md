# Item 6: Reverse-Engineering Figma Make: Extracting React Apps from Binary Files

Source: [https://albertsikkema.com/ai/development/tools/reverse-engineering/2026/01/23/reverse-engineering-figma-make-files.html](https://albertsikkema.com/ai/development/tools/reverse-engineering/2026/01/23/reverse-engineering-figma-make-files.html)

Summary:
A technical walkthrough of extracting a React codebase from Figma Make's proprietary .make files, which are actually ZIP archives containing binary-encoded project data. The author details the process of identifying compression formats, decoding Figma's Kiwi schema, and reconstructing source files—including React components and assets—for local development. The article also covers practical challenges like import path rewriting and asset conversion.

Key takeaways:
- Figma Make .make files are ZIP archives with a custom binary format (Kiwi schema) containing all app source code.
- Extraction requires decompressing with both deflate and Zstandard, then decoding the schema to retrieve code files.
- Automated scripts can reconstruct a working React app, but require handling import paths, asset formats, and dependency quirks.
- The approach enables full recovery of React projects from Figma Make, useful for migration or code audits.

# Reverse-Engineering Figma Make: Extracting React Apps from Binary Files

A client came to me with a beautiful UI. They’d built it in Figma Make, the AI-powered prototyping tool. The app looked stunning, animations were smooth. Just one problem: I couldn’t get to the actual code. Normally you can use the api or export design files, but not with Make. The Figma API Returns `{"status":400,"err":"File type not supported by this endpoint"}` for Make files.

Why would you not be able to do that? The wonders of corporate lock-in, I suppose.

That’s a problem: no design file. What now? So on to searching for ways to extract the code.

## Update - January 29, 2026

A few useful tips from readers:

- **Use the [`file`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html) command first**: Before reaching for `xxd`, running `file ClientApp.make` would have identified it as a ZIP archive immediately. Good reminder to start with the obvious tools.
- **Try [`binwalk`](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) for unknown binaries**: It scans for known file signatures and can identify embedded files within a single binary. Worth trying early in the process.

Now let’s get into it.

## The Discovery: It’s Just a ZIP File

So I started clicking around the Figma interface, looking for anything useful. That’s when I noticed you can download the `.make` file itself. Download. A file, interesting!

But I can not read it. Hmmm, what now? Rule number one: never trust the extension. A `.make` file could be anything. After a while I figured out it was a ZIP file. And in it was in essence a React application.

## The Discovery: It’s Just a ZIP File

First thing I did was look at the raw bytes:

```
xxd -l 4 "ClientApp.make"
# Output: 504b 0304
```

`504b` is `PK` in ASCII. That’s the ZIP file signature. The whole mysterious `.make` file is just a ZIP archive with a different extension. Learned something new today (about `504b`).

Unzip it:

```
ClientApp.make (ZIP)
├── canvas.fig          # 2.3 MB binary - the interesting part
├── meta.json           # Project metadata
├── ai_chat.json        # 34 MB of AI conversation history
├── thumbnail.png       # Preview image
├── images/             # 110 image assets (hash-named, no extensions)
└── blob_store/         # Additional binary data
```

The `ai_chat.json` was massive. Every prompt, every response, every iteration the client went through while building the app. Not very useful, and not what I needed. (although i did try to extract design tokens from it at first, before turning to the binary file).

The `canvas.fig` file held the actual code. 2.3 MB of binary data. That extension sounds more like a standard Figma design file. How to read that and see if it contains anything useful? Time to dig deeper.

## Decoding the Binary Format

Looking at the header:

```
xxd -l 20 canvas.fig
# Output: 6669 672d 6d61 6b65 65... (fig-makee)
```

Standard Figma design files use `fig-kiwi` as their magic header. Make files use `fig-makee`. Different format, same general approach.

The structure:

| Offset | Size | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 9 bytes | Magic: `fig-makee` |
| 9 | 3 bytes | Padding |
| 12 | 4 bytes | Chunk 1 size (little-endian) |
| 16 | N bytes | Chunk 1 data |
| 16+N | 4 bytes | Chunk 2 size |
| 20+N | M bytes | Chunk 2 data |

Two chunks. Two different compression algorithms. Thanks for some AI help here, LLMs are great at spotting patterns in binary data.

## The Compression Puzzle

First attempt: zlib decompression on both chunks.

```
Error: Invalid stored block lengths
```

The first chunk decompressed fine with zlib/deflate. The second chunk refused. Checking its magic bytes: `28 B5 2F FD`. That’s Zstandard compression. Different algorithm entirely.

So:

- **Chunk 1 (Schema)**: Deflate compressed, 24KB → 59KB decompressed
- **Chunk 2 (Data)**: Zstandard compressed, 2.2MB → 29MB decompressed

Three npm packages made this work: `pako` for deflate, `fzstd` for Zstandard, and `kiwi-schema` for decoding the binary data format. Again, LLMs to the rescue. I know a bit about compression, but this would have taken me a lot of time to figure out alone. And probably would have given up (rewards vs time invested).

## Kiwi Schema: Figma’s Binary Format

Figma uses the Kiwi binary schema format. It’s compact but has no schema definition included. Fortunately, Chunk 1 contains exactly that: the schema.

The schema had 534 type definitions. Nodes, colors, vectors, transforms, fonts, and the one I cared about: `CODE_FILE`.

Decoding the message data revealed a tree structure with 159 nodes:

```
{
  "nodeChanges": [
    {
      "type": "DOCUMENT",
      "children": [...]
    },
    {
      "type": "CODE_FILE",
      "name": "App.tsx",
      "sourceCode": "import React from 'react'..."
    },
    // ... 157 more nodes
  ]
}
```

Every React component, utility function and CSS file were there in the `sourceCode` property. Progress! Now how to get to the content, the actual files?

Structure of canvas.fig and how it decodes to source code

Finding `CODE_FILE` nodes with source code was straightforward:

```
const codeFiles = nodeChanges.filter(
  node => node.type === 'CODE_FILE' && node.sourceCode
);
```

96 source files extracted:

- React components (`.tsx`)
- TypeScript utilities (`.ts`)
- CSS files including `globals.css`
- Data files
- React hooks

But having files isn’t the same as having a working app. Now to piece it all together, in a working structure:

## From Files to Running App

The extracted code had some quirks:

**Versioned package imports**: Figma Make embeds version numbers directly in import statements.

```
// What Figma Make generates
import { Dialog } from '@radix-ui/react-dialog@1.1.6'

// What actually works
import { Dialog } from '@radix-ui/react-dialog'
```

**Custom asset imports**: Images use a proprietary format.

```
// What Figma Make generates
import heroImage from 'figma:asset/a1b2c3d4.png'

// What actually works
const heroImage = '/images/a1b2c3d4.png'
```

**Missing file extensions**: All images in the `images/` folder were hash-named with no extensions. The browser needs `.png` to serve them correctly.

**Tailwind CSS v4 changes**: The PostCSS integration changed between versions. Needed `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of using `tailwindcss` directly.

**React StrictMode breaking animations**: The original code used Framer Motion. StrictMode double-mounts components, which breaks timers and animations. Removing StrictMode fixed it.

I wrote scripts to handle all of this automatically. Analyze imports, determine folder structure (based on import references in the files), fix paths, copy images with proper extensions, generate `package.json`, Vite config, and TypeScript config.

## The Result

```
cd make_extraction
./run-all.sh ../ClientApp.make
cd output/react_app
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

A working React application on localhost:5173. Same components, same styling, same animations. No manual conversion work. No information lost.

Beyond source code, I also extracted design tokens using regex patterns:

- Hex colors: `#1a1a1a`, `#ffffff`
- RGBA values: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- HSL colors: `hsl(220, 14%, 96%)`
- CSS variables: `--primary-color: #3b82f6`
- Google Fonts: `Inter`, `Roboto`

All exported to `design-tokens.json` for easy reference or migration to a design system.

## Lessons Learned

**Don’t assume compression types**: The same file can use multiple compression algorithms for different chunks. Check the magic bytes.

**Figma’s internal format is consistent**: Whether it’s a design file or a code project, the underlying structure uses Kiwi schemas. Different content, same parsing approach.

**React StrictMode has side effects**: It’s great for catching bugs during development, but it can break production code that relies on mount/unmount timing.

**The original code is usually correct**: I wasted time “fixing” fonts that weren’t broken. The extraction was accurate; my assumptions weren’t.

And most interesting: Figma Make is a great tool, but under the hood it is straightforward React with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. No magic, just well-structured code generation. (and i have to give it to them, the code quality is pretty good for AI-generated code!).

So after spending 3 hours reverse-engineering and an hour writing this post, I can now finally get to work on the actual app :-) Have a great day!
